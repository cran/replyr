Description: Methods to get a grip on working with remote 'tbl' sources ('SQL' databases,
    'sparklyr' 'Spark' 2.0.0 and above) through 'dplyr'.  Adds convenience functions to make such tasks more like
    working with an in-memory 'data.frame'.  Results do depend on which 'dplyr' data service you use.
