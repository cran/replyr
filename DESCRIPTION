Description: Methods to use 'dplyr' remote data sources ('SQL' databases,
   'Spark' 2.0.0 and above) in a reliable "generic" fashion (generic meaning
   user code works similarly on all such sources, without needing per-source
   adaption).
   Adds convenience functions to make such tasks more like
   working with an in-memory R 'data.frame'.
