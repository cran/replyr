\description{
Number of row in a table.  This function is not "group aware" it returns the total number of rows, not rows per dplyr group.
Also \code{replyr_nrow} depends on data being returned to count, so some corner cases (such as zero columns) will count as zero rows.
In particular work around dplyr issue 2871 \url{https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/2871}.

\examples{

d <- data.frame(x=c(1,2))
replyr_nrow(d)
